Other side notes:

"BeReal meets big screens—authentic moments, instant gratification"
"Event Photo booths without the booth. Your whole venue becomes the frame." << This one sounds good fr>>

"Instagram Stories for live events—guests swipe up photos to instantly appear on venue screens."

For Wedding Planners:
"Your venue becomes a living photo album. Guests feel like they're feeding a digital fireplace with memories."

For Corporate Events:
"Turn dead networking time into photo competitions. Watch productivity conferences become surprisingly social."

For Venue Managers:
"Every blank wall becomes interactive revenue. Charge $300+ for 'digital photo experiences' using just a projector."

Competitors:

Create a competitor matrix out of all of these and let me know how spevents is different / competitive / why someone would choose spevents over this. Another side note that I was checking out was that most of these are for weddings, whereas spevents.live should also be for other types of events, like conferences and stuff. Let me know how I should be prioritizing my next steps with spevents regarding this.

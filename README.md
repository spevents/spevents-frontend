## What is Spevents?

Spevents makes it easy to collect and display guest photos at live events. Guests simply:

1. Scan a QR code (no app download needed)
2. Take photos through their phone's browser
3. See their photos instantly appear on the venue's big screen

Both hosts and guests keep their photos - hosts get a complete event album, while guests keep digital mementos similar to photo booth strips.

### The Problem

Events have a "photo problem" - guests take lots of photos but sharing them is fragmented and happens after the event, when excitement has faded. Traditional solutions ask guests to upload photos to shared albums or cloud storage, which creates friction and delays sharing.

### Solution

- **Instant Sharing**: Photos appear on the venue screen moments after being taken
- **No Downloads**: Works entirely through the web browser
- **Simple Access**: Just scan a QR code to start
- **Multiple Display Modes**: Dynamic presentation options for different event types
- **Automatic Organization**: Photos are instantly stored and organized for hosts
